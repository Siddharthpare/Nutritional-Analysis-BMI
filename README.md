# Nutrition-Analysis-BMI
DESCRIPTION:
Nutrition analysis involves the process of determining the nutritional content of foods and food products. This analysis helps in understanding the levels of various nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, present in food. It is crucial for ensuring food safety, developing dietary guidelines, and providing accurate nutritional information to consumers.

Calculation of BMI-Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical value derived from an individual's weight and height. It is a widely used screening tool to categorize individuals based on their body weight relative to their height, and it helps in identifying whether they fall into underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obesity categories.

The formula for calculating BMI is as follows:
BMI= Weight(Kg)/Height(m)^2
